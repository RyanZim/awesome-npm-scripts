# Contribution Guidelines

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Suggested packages should be tested and documented.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[package](link) - Description.`
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
  - Please run `npm run doctoc` after making changes to the headings to regenerate the Contents section.
- Link to the GitHub repo, not npmjs.com.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the package and why it should be included.
- You can run `npm test` to ensure that you haven't made any errors (Thanks to [awesome-lint](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-lint)).

Thank you for your suggestions!
